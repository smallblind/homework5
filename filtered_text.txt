Repairs You Can Do and How-To Guides 
If you've made it this far you're no doubt ready to dive in and tackle your next repair. How do we know you're ready? Because you're determined, and because you were smart enough to come to About.com to find out more! The list of common repairs you'll find in this section will save you time, money and frustration dealing with your mechanic. Sometimes you have to bite the bullet and let a professional take care of things. The rest of the time, it's all about you, your tools and the feeling of empowerment when you look at a job **** done. 
How To Replace Your Oxygen Sensor 
Is your Check Engine Light haunting you from the dash like a tiny, orange, burning ember? If it is, there's a fairly good chance that a bad O2 sensor is causing the problem. These sensors go bad all the time. Some experts say that new fuels with higher ethanol content are causing parts of our cars, including the O2 sensors, to go bad prematurely. Whether this is the case or not, if your CEL (Check Engine Light) is on you won't be on the road much longer thanks to most states' inspection programs. 
Of course before you go replacing an O2 sensor you'll want to be sure that's the problem. Even the parts are expensive, not to mention the labor if you're paying a shop to do the work for you. A Check Engine Light can mean a lot of things, and even though the oxygen sensor is often the culprit, there are hundreds of other possibilities. 
How do you know if your **** or truck needs a new O2 sensor? 
The answer to this question is simple. Your Check Engine Light is on because the **** is "throwing a code." In tech speak this means that the **** has detected a malfunctioning system, and has produced an error message which caused the Check Engine Light to come on. With a code reader, you can read this error, called an OBD Code, and determine if the O2 sensor is the culprit. If you don't have a code reader, there's a free and easy way to retrieve that error message. Learn how. 
The question of whether or not you can replace your own O2 sensor will probably be answered by figuring out what type your **** or truck has. There are two types of sensor, a screw-in type and a weld-in type. Needless to say there are a lot of differences in what goes into the installation of these two types of sensors. Save yourself some time and energy by figuring it out ahead of time. 
The best way to determine what type of O2 sensor you have is to consult your repair manual, or simply ask the clerk at the **** parts store. They can look up your **** by make and model and tell you in less than 5 minutes whether you are on the road to a DIY job, or headed to the repair shop. If you are blessed with the screw-in type, read on and you can replace your own. You'll save major bucks. If you are cursed with a weld-in type sensor (unless you're a welder) you probably need to head to the repair shop for this job. Don't try to install a weld-in O2 sensor with something like epoxy -- it won't stand up to the task. 
Now that you have determined that you have a screw-in type O2 sensor and you think you can tackle the task of installing it yourself, let's get to it. The good news is once you get to it, the job isn't super tough. Start by spraying the sensor with a good penetrant to loosen it up a bit. The constant heating and **** of that area can make any **** tough to remove. If you want to do this job more safely and easily, I recommend buying a proper oxygen sensor wrench. This will ensure an easy removal of the old sensor without damaging any of the delicate wires hanging out of it. 
If your O2 sensor is being stubborn, you may have to apply the added force of a breaker bar to get it out of there. This is not uncommon, so don't be afraid to add some leverage to the equation. 
With your old sensor out, you are ready to get the new one in. Start the installation by **** so you can be sure you don't crossthread the expensive new sensor. That would suck. Using the same wrench you used to safely remove the old oxygen sensor, install the new one tightly. You can now reconnect the wiring to the sensor. Once you've done that, the job is done! 
*If your Check Engine Light was on before this repair, it may go out by itself when your car's **** starts analyzing the new data. If it doesn't you can try disconnecting the **** overnight for reset, or take it to a shop and ask them to reset the **** for you. 
How To Replace Spark Plug Wires 
Spark **** wires are one of the more neglected parts of most engines. It's not that they don't go bad, but most people don't replace their **** wires until one of them is so bad it's causing their **** to run badly. Did you know that one of the major causes of Check Engine Lights is a bad **** wire? A faulty **** **** wire can cause an **** misfire, which will trigger the **** and cost you a **** to the repair shop to **** it off. I recommend new **** **** wires every 30,000 miles or so. They can last much longer, but when they go bad you'll spend much more time and money on the repair than you would have on the prevention. 
The point is this: Spark **** wires are easy insurance against a breakdown. Take the time to replace them and you'll be doing yourself a favor. Do the job while you install new **** plugs and you're really saving time. 
This may seem like a superfluous step in the process, but it's major. if you're working on a 4-cylinder engine, a straight 6, and most V8 engines, your job is probably very easy. Now's the time to take a look at your **** to see if you can easily reach all of the **** **** wires. Remove the "fashion cover" that hides all of the **** components, and see if you can see all of the **** wires and access holes. If you can, you can skip to this simple step and celebrate. Your job is easy. If you can't easily reach all of your **** wires, your afternoon just got longer. In many modern engines half of the **** plugs are way out of reach, and replacement requires removal of one or more **** components. The following how-to steps will guide you through a typical replacement that involves difficulties such as this. Take it slow, and take notes -- you shouldn't have any problems! 
If you've made it this far, you have an **** that makes it very difficult to change your plugs and wires. Don't sweat it. Your day may be longer, but take it step by step and you won't have any problems. 
The first step is to remove the **** box. The **** box contains your **** filter, and connects to the large intake plenum that you can see is hiding the rest of your **** **** wires. If you have a large flexible hose connecting the **** box to the plenum, you can remove the clamps that hold the hose on each end, and remove the hose, leaving the **** box in place. If your **** box and hose are one unit, you'll have to unbolt the entire box. Before removing the hose or the box, check to see what electrical connections you may need to disconnect first.* *If you want to be sure you properly reconnect your electrical plugs, take a digital photo of the **** box setup before you remove anything, or draw a diagram to aid your memory. 
Before you can remove the intake plenum, there are a number of electrical connections, cables, nuts, bolts and who knows what else for you to deal with. Take your time. Start with all of the electrical plugs. A digital photo may help you remember where all of these connections are. You'll also need to disconnect the **** cable from the throttle body on the back of the intake plenum (if your **** is equipped with a cable). Now you need to remove all of the nuts and bolts holding the intake onto the head, and there will be lots. Brackets, studs, and threaded holes all hold this thing on. Take your time and visually move over every inch of the intake before you start to pull and tug. It may take a little force to remove, but be sure you've reached that point before you start to go for it. Sometimes the gaskets can act a little like glue, holding things together tightly. If you think this is the case, a few taps with a soft mallet can help get things moving. 
With all of the junk removed, you can finally see those **** **** wires sticking out of the back of the engine! WAIT! Don't start yanking them out just yet. You need to replace the **** wires one at a time to ensure you don't mix up any of the connections. Replacing them one at a time insures they will be reinstalled in the correct location. Also, I find that it helps to lay all of the new **** **** wires out on a clean table so that you can best match up the old wire with the new one according to length. 
And hey, while you have the wires off, it's a great time to replace the **** plugs! You didn't do all of that work just to have to do it again the next time you need a tune up. 
How To Replace a Rear Brake, Turn Signal or Back Up Light Bulb 
Every bulb on the outside of your **** has a safety function. This may seem obvious, but think about how often you see somebody driving around with a tail **** out, or with only one **** light. The fact is these little bulbs are often neglected. Many people don't replace them until they get pulled over and have to try to avoid the fine. It only takes a second to inspect all of your bulbs (check out our back up **** trick for testing those guys.) 
Don't be a slacker. Take 5 minutes and do a walkaround. Even if you find a dead bulb, we can help you replace it in no time. The last thing you want is a ticket or an accident. 
The bulbs for all of your red, white and yellow **** are hidden behind a colored lens. In most cars and trucks they're all in one **** but some vehicles used a few separate lens assemblies. Either way the same process applies. 
First you need to remove the lens housing from the car. It's usually held in **** with a few Phillips-head screws. Be sure to put them someplace safe. Now's not the time to lose a screw. 
Now that you have the screws out and safely stowed you can pull the entire bulb assembly, or housing, out of its hole. You won't be able to pull it out too far because of all the wiring holding it in, but you don't need much space. Just don't pull hard on the wiring. Most assemblies will pull out as a whole, but some have a removable outer cover. These are even easier so if you have one you should count your tiny blessings. 
The bulbs in your **** **** or tail **** assembly are held in **** using a **** that holds the bulb, that also screws into the **** assembly. Follow the wires to the back of the **** that you need to replace, that's the bulb holder you want to unscrew. It doesn't actually screw, it only takes a quarter **** or so to unseat it and pull it out. 
Finally! You can see the **** (or lack thereof) at the end of the tunnel, a dead bulb. Your bulb either pulls straight out (most do these days) or requires a quarter **** twist like the bulb holder did. Remove the bad bulb and put the new one in. Now you're legal, and safe. 
Without a **** pump, your **** will quickly starve. A bad **** pump will kill things quickly. You can easily replace and install an electric **** pump. This how to will guide you through the process step by step. 
Level of Difficulty: Moderate 
What You'll Need: 
Fire Extinguisher! 
Replacement Fuel Pump 
New Fuel Line 
Open End Wrench Set 
Socket Set 
Flat Head Screwdriver 
Phillips Head Screwdriver 
Large Fuel Catch Container 
When you're ready to replace your **** pump, be sure you have safety in mind. Work in an open, **** ventilated area, and be sure you have a fire extinguisher close by. 
An electric **** pump produces high **** pressure to supply your electronic **** injection **** with plenty of pressurized fuel. The pressure doesn't go away just because you **** the **** off. You'll need to take steps to release the **** pressure before you can remove the **** pump or any associated parts. 
Here are instructions on how to release your **** pressure in one simple step. When you're sure there is no **** pressure in the **** lines or **** pump, you can proceed with the **** pump removal. 
There are two types of electric **** pump. One type mounts inside the **** tank, the other mounts underneath the **** just in front of the **** tank. If your **** pump mounts underneath the car, it will be held in by a couple of bolts. You can locate your **** pump by sliding underneath the **** (if you can't fit, you can **** the **** securely on **** stands) and looking just in front of the **** **** on one **** of the **** or the other. You can also follow the **** line from the **** to the **** pump. The pump will often be in a black insulating sleeve. Unbolt it and let it drop down slightly. You won't be able to remove it from the sleeve until everything is disconnected. 
If you have the type of **** pump that mounts inside the **** tank, you'll need to remove it from inside the car. The access point to an in-tank **** pump is either underneath your back seat, or if you're lucky it's under carpet and an access **** in the trunk. 
When you've located the pump, you'll need to disconnect everything before you remove it from the tank. This is covered in the following steps.Now that you can clearly see everything, you need to disconnect the **** lines. If you have an in-tank pump, there will be one line on the **** of the pump that needs to be disconnected. If you have an under **** pump there will be both a line in and a line out. These are also called the low pressure and high pressure **** of the pump. 
To remove the lines, loosen the hose clamp or fitting that are holding the low pressure **** in, then loosen the fitting and remove the line. 
Be sure to have something on **** to catch the **** that leaks from the lines so that it doesn't splash the **** and create a fire hazard.The last step in removing your **** pump is disconnecting the wires that **** the pump. There will be two wires, one is positive, the other ground. It's a good idea to make a note of which is which. What seems obvious while you're taking it off can be baffling when it's time to put it all back. The wires will be held on by plugs, screws, or really small bolts. 
With everything disconnected, you're ready to remove the pump. As the saying goes, installation is the **** of removal, so go ahead!If you're driving around with a big hole in your car's plastic bumper, you need to stop. There's no reason to disgrace your beloved **** or truck by subjecting it to ridicule due to the gaping tear in its otherwise beautifully painted plastic **** cover. Seriously though, even a minor accident can result in a damaged bumper. Sometimes you're lucky and you can get away with simply sanding and painting the damaged area. But an impact as low speed as 15 mph is more than enough to tear a big gash into your **** cover, resulting in unsightly damage that you don't have to live with. 
The professionals use expensive epoxies, heat, plastic welding and other techniques to repair these bumpers. Not to mention the cost of a professional repaint. If you want it to be perfect, you should take it to a professional and let them repair, or often replace, your **** cover. But if you aren't obsessed with perfection, or the value of your vehicle doesn't support spending that much money on the repair, the steps we took on this **** might appeal to you. We were able to repair this car's **** -- including a custom mixed paint for a perfect color match -- for less than $100. That's real savings. If you've just got a chip in the paint, check out this easy repair.The first step in repairing a plastic **** is to clean the wound, so to speak. Chances are your damage was not a simple cut. Before you patch it, you need to cut off any bits that are sticking out. Anything that's breaking the natural contour of the **** needs to be cut off. It may seem counterproductive to make your hole even bigger before you patch it, but those pieces sticking out will prevent you from creating a smooth surface with the patch. Large pieces can be cut off with a razor blade. Any small burrs or sections can be sanded down with 80-100 grit sandpaper. 
Next, clean the back of the **** as good as you can. If you can access the area behind the damage, that's perfect. Clean it well, and scuff it with your sandpaper. If you can't access it directly, do anything you can to clean the backside of the **** near the damage.In order to create as lasting a repair as possible, you need to reinforce the area behind the holes before you add any filler to the front. To do this, cut a piece of **** repair cloth or mesh that is sized about an inch larger than your hole on all sides. Soak the cloth with fiberglass impregnated body filler and press it onto the back **** of your damage holes. Allow at least 3 hours for the repair patch to set before proceeding to the next step.Once the patch has set, you can start to add filler to the front. I recommend a fiberglass-reinforced filler (the green Bondo) for strength. Add thin layers allowing them to dry between applications. See the section on filler for more info. When you're finished, sand the are smooth.Now that you've filled, sanded, and loved your bumper, it's time to spray the color on. We recommend ordering your paint as a custom mix. This produces much better results generally than the over the counter paint. It comes in an aerosol can and is easy to use, but the color actually matches! We found lots of them, but one guy you can find easily on Amazon.com seemed like the best, and we got a perfect match to a paint color that is not even available as an over-the-counter touch up paint! 
Carefully mask the area around your repair and spray the smooth repair. Remember, many **** coats are better than ewer heavy coats! 
If your **** uses a clearcoat type of paint, add layers of clearcoat once you're happy with your paint job. 
In the beginning, **** powered vehicles used a **** to get **** into the engine. This worked well, but when **** injection came along, things changed quickly. Fuel injection, especially electronic **** injection produces fewer **** and greatly increases **** mileage. 
The **** was an ingenious invention in itself. Your car's **** has 4 cycles, and one of them is a "suck" cycle. Put simply, the **** sucks (creates extreme vacuum inside the cylinder) and when it does, the **** was there to let the right amount of **** and **** get sucked into the engine. While great, this **** lacked the precision of a pressurized injection system. 
Enter **** injection. Your **** still sucks, but instead of relying on the suck, **** injection shoots exactly the right amount of **** into the chamber. Fuel injection systems have gone through a few evolutions, adding electronics was a big step, but the idea has remained the same: an electrically activated **** (the injector) spraying a metered amount of **** into your engine.Single port **** injection systems spray **** into a central intake, that then sucks the **** and **** into the **** all at once. This was sort of an in-between invention that combined a **** and **** injection. Most European and Japanese cars skipped this step and went directly to multi-port **** injection, while American makes used it.Multi-port injection is still widely in use today. So far it's the most efficient method of metering **** into the engine. Multi-port **** injection, also known as MFI, consists of an injector for each **** in the engine. This injector sprays **** directly through the intake **** or valves into the **** chamber. Each injector is activated separately by wire. Early versions of this system, such as CIS, Jetronic and Motronic utilized a **** distributor that metered **** to the injectors through separate **** lines. Later versions utilize a single **** line that connects to a **** rail on **** of the engine. The injectors take **** from the central **** rail and squirt it into the **** when told to do so.With **** engines making a comeback, there has been more focus in recent years on **** efficiency. Direct injection **** engines utilize an injector that sprays **** directly past the glow **** into the **** chamber. The technology developed here allows for more complete burning of the **** fuel, and thus better efficiency and less stinky smoke discharged into the atmosphere.How do **** injection systems know how much **** to squirt anyway? Somewhere along the line, somebody (probably at Bosch) realized that you could measure how much **** your **** needed by how much **** it was sucking in. Once your **** starts, the measuring of **** begins. Early **** injection systems used a vane system, which was basically a **** inside a tube, to measure how much **** was being sucked. 
Later systems use a "hot wire" to figure it out. When you **** your **** on, the wire becomes red hot. As **** is sucked past this wire, it gets a little cooler. The car's brain measures exactly how much cooler it's getting and uses this number to figure out how much **** it's sucking. Then it squirts the correct amount of **** into the engine. 
There are lots and lots of variations to **** injection systems. We've got electrnic **** injection, mechanical **** injection, systems with one oxygen sensor, systems with four oxygen sensors ... but the basics remain the same. 
Your **** are probably the most important part of your car. Without an intake system, you'll just sit there. But at least you won't hit a tree while you're just sitting there! Seriously, **** aren't something to play around with. If your **** is having a braking problem, whether it's weak brakes, a mushy pedal, grinding sounds - whatever your **** problem is, you need to troubleshoot and repair it as soon as possible. We'll help you diagnose your braking problem so you know what repairs to make. 
Brake Pedal Goes Too Far Down to Stop. If you step on the **** **** and it feels like it's going too far down before you start to slow, you might have the following problems: 
Low Brake Fluid Level: Check your **** fluid. If it's low, **** it off to the mark on the **** of the reservoir. 
Contaminated Brake Fluid: Even though your **** operate in a closed system, contaminants can still work there way into the works. Air can enter the **** through the smallest hole, and you can end up with water in the **** from condensation and other means. There's not really any way to check for this, but bleeding your **** will remove the bad stuff and replace it with new fluid. 
Worn Brake Pads: Your **** should never wear low enough to cause your **** **** to feel low, they'll scream at you before then. But if they do get very low, you might have this problem. Replace your **** pads as soon as possible. Of course, this can be avoided with regular **** inspection. 
Bad Brake Power Boost Unit: Finally, if your **** booster goes bad you'll have low **** **** issues. Most **** boosters are vacuum controlled, so a special vacuum measurement device that connects to the **** booster is needed to check it. If it's bad, you'll have to replace the boost unit. 
Never change your **** while the **** is hot! Let it cool for a few hours, **** can burn you badly. 
Be sure you have a safe area to do your **** change. Level, solid ground is a must so that you can safely **** up your car. I also like to put something on the driveway or garage **** underneath the **** in case you spill. Cardboard or a piece of plywood are great for this. 
Before you even start to do your **** change, be sure you have everything you need to get the job done. 
Caution! If you drove your **** recently, your **** could be very hot. Allow at least two hours for your **** to cool before you start your **** change. Oil burns are very dangerous. 
What You'll Need 
Ratchet or open end wrench 
Oil **** wrench 
Oil catch/recycle container 
Funnel 
New **** **** 
New Oil 
Clean **** 
The first step in an **** change is to get the old stuff out of there. The **** drains out of the **** pan at the very bottom of your engine. The **** is held in by a drain **** that looks like a big **** at the bottom of the pan. 
Warning! When your **** is warmed up, your **** **** can be as hot as 250 degrees! It's crucial that you allow at least two hours before you drain your **** to avoid a very serious burn. 
Before you remove the **** drain plug, be sure that your recycling container is positioned underneath the **** drain. An **** change can be no fun if most of your time is spent cleaning up oil. 
When you remove the drain plug, let it drop into the **** of the recycling container. There's a screen on **** that will keep it from dropping into the muck. 
Let all of the **** drain out, then replace the drain plug, tightening it to your cars torque specifications (or "snug but not too hard" if you are sans torque **** 
Put the **** on the **** recycling container so you can drop it off at a location that accepts used **** -- most full service **** stations accept it.Next you need to remove your old **** filter. Using an **** **** wrench, **** the **** counterclockwise until it's free. Be careful with it, it's still full of old **** that can spill and make a mess. 
Some **** filters can be reached from the top, but for most you'll have to be under the car.With the old **** out and the old **** out of the way, it's time to put the change in **** change. But before you install the new **** filter, you have to prep it. 
Before you screw the new **** **** into place, lubricate the rubber **** on the end of the **** with some new oil. 
Next, fill the new **** **** with **** to about 2/3. It's ok if you go over that amount, it just means you might spill a bit when you screw it on.Carefully screw the new **** **** into place. Remember, it has **** in it so don't forget to hold it upright. It screws on clockwise. 
You don't need a wrench to install the new **** filter. Screw it on as tight as you can get it with one hand. Overtightening the **** **** can strip its threads and cause a leak. Of course, not tightening it enough can cause a leak. So screw it on as tight as it will go with one hand, but no more.Now you're ready to fill the **** with oil. Unscrew the **** fill **** and insert your funnel. I like to buy the 5-quart containers of **** (cheaper) but if you're using single quarts that's fine, too. 
Check your owner's **** to find out how much **** your **** holds. Pour a little more than 3/4 that amount into the engine. For example, if your **** holds 4 quarts of oil, add 3 1/2. 
If you're using a 5-quart container of oil, there is a guide on the **** that shows how much **** you've put in. 
You're not finished yet so don't **** off. 
We didn't add all the **** because there may still be a little **** here and there we didn't **** for. 
Check your **** and add more until you're at the right level. 
Be sure to put your **** **** back on! Oil spray can cause a fire. 
As part of your vehicle registration you are issued a set of general-issue **** plates. The **** number is assigned to you by the TxDMV, **** be personalized. 

The plates are good for seven years, and then you are required to obtain a new set of plates from your local county tax office. Mandatory replacement is necessary because at seven years the reflectivity of the **** **** sheeting begins to diminish. 

When a new general-issue **** **** design is released, it takes several years before all registered vehicle owners receive the plates. Those with previous general-issue **** designs that are less than seven years old keep that design until mandatory replacement becomes necessary.Sunroofs, by historical definition, are opaque. The first **** company to offer a **** as a standard option was the Nash Motor Company as an option on some of its 1937 models.[1] Today, most factory sliding **** options feature a glass **** and are sometimes marketed as moonroofs, a term introduced in 1973 by John Atkinson, a marketing manager at Ford for the Lincoln Continental Mark IV. For the first year, Ford sent out its Mark IVs to American Sunroof Company for offline installation. 

Variations of both the **** and moonroof have become the norm in both factory installed and aftermarket offerings, creating a wide range of features and choices. 

Sunroof systems may be **** or electric, while most moonroof systems are electric/electronic. Manual sunroofs may be lever actuated, as in venting type pop-ups, **** lever or crank operated for sliding systems. Electric **** systems are usually cable driven by a **** and feature some form of sliding opening. Most moonroof systems today are electric and have either a combination pop-up/inbuilt or a pop-up/spoiler configuration (see Sunroof Types below). 

Roof systems may be original equipment, factory options (provided by the **** company), or installed aftermarket by a **** installation professional for the **** dealer or retail customer. Once the vehicle leaves the assembly line, the factory option can no longer be integrated into the roof, making aftermarket the only option. 

Open sunroofs have occasionally led to break-ins using small children or to practical jokes such as filling a car's **** with Styrofoam peanuts 
In automobiles, a **** **** (also known as **** assisted **** (PAS) or **** assist system) helps drivers steer by augmenting **** effort of the **** wheel. Hydraulic or electric actuators add controlled energy to the **** mechanism, so the driver needs to provide only modest effort regardless of conditions. Power **** helps considerably when a vehicle is stopped or moving slowly. Also, **** **** provides some feedback of forces acting on the front wheels to give an ongoing sense of how the wheels are interacting with the road; this is typically called "rÎ¿ad feel". 

Representative **** **** systems for cars augment **** effort via an actuator, a hydraulic cylinder, which is part of a servo system. These systems have a direct mechanical connection between the **** **** and the linkage that steers the wheels. This means that power-steering **** failure (to augment effort) still permits the vehicle to be steered using **** effort alone. 

Other **** **** systems (such as those in the largest off-road construction vehicles) have no direct mechanical connection to the **** linkage; they require power. Systems of this kind, with no mechanical connection, are sometimes called "drive by wire" or "steer by wire", by analogy with aviation's "fly-by-wire". In this context, "wire" refers to electrical cables that carry **** and data, not thin-wire-rope mechanical **** cables. 

In other **** **** systems, electric motors provide the assistance instead of hydraulic systems. As with hydraulic types, **** to the actuator (motor, in this case) is controlled by the rest of the power-steering system. 

Some construction vehicles have a two-part **** with a rugged hinge in the middle; this hinge allows the front and **** axles to become non-parallel to steer the vehicle. Opposing hydraulic cylinders move the halves of the **** relative to each other to steer.
